    bio: "I'm a super motivated Computer Science graduate from Georgia State University. Mondays to Fridays (and sometimes on weekends, too) I'm a web developer for a marketing agency in Atlanta. Ever since I can remember, fixing things came naturally to me. With a relentless work ethic, I won't rest until the problem's solved! I love learning and using cutting-edge technologies such as React and Node to build work &amp; personal projects. During my spare time, I enjoy spending time outdoors, trying new restaurants in the city, taking coding courses online, and, overall, being a total computer nerd.",
